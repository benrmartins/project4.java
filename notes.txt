4. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed

   This project was difficult. But I was able to put into practice what I learned from
   lecture and discussion into this assignment. Getting extra help by going to the office
   hours and SI was very helpful. Using the lecture slides from class was very helpful in
   this project.
